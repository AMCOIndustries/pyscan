* fixed to enable full backwards compatibility with loops. Now all backwards compatibility features have been tested and are working; however, it might still be worth updating the test/general/test_legacy_naming_convention.py file (which is currently just a placeholder) to test this into the future. I will validate this as a task with Andy before embarking. ([`fa04968`](https://github.com/AMCOIndustries/pyscan/commit/fa04968936e2dca44af66001b65ae9e0f60c514c))

* further updates to include experiment instead of sweep; however, demo notebook 07 still needs to change loops to scans. Currently using for testing reverse compatibility as I try to make this work with legacy loops naming though it currently can&#39;t change legacy loop values because they have no setter. ([`41c567d`](https://github.com/AMCOIndustries/pyscan/commit/41c567d015163008dc5a534f31fa88833733fbf9))

* implemented new naming convention which passes all tests except for legacy incorporation of the &#39;loop&#39; nomenclature because there is currently no setter for the loop @property attributes.

* adding generalizable testing suite to implement with drivers for validating there property behavior based on and refined from test cases in test_instrumentdriver.py. New file&#39;s current name is test_for_drivers.py ([`2a7b7cf`](https://github.com/AMCOIndustries/pyscan/commit/2a7b7cf5aa74ae437f01280170b24697e570fda1))

* ensured that test_instrumentdriver.py could test for any number of ranges inputs... ok, well maybe not infinity! Though is infinity a number? Regardless, I challenge you to create infinite ranges inputs. ([`28704a2`](https://github.com/AMCOIndustries/pyscan/commit/28704a2a991cb274a5ee86914e5f9616626f997f))

* updated test_instrumentdriver to be more ubiquitous ([`e89db98`](https://github.com/AMCOIndustries/pyscan/commit/e89db9897fc194b918c1aa98aba8f6e5b3f7480d))

* generating new test_instrumentdrivery.py file. Currently modifying to develop methods for testing all driver properties based on property type. ([`0467f3f`](https://github.com/AMCOIndustries/pyscan/commit/0467f3f9d02065a1e7ec074d2fc1bd978c9617b0))

* updated instrumentdriver.py to automatically add settings attribute for each driver property. This commit is before overhauling testvoltage.py, which will introduce fundamental changes that are likely to break things and may need to be reversed, but could be quite useful for testing instrument driver... ([`8d8fbcd`](https://github.com/AMCOIndustries/pyscan/commit/8d8fbcd7f3b6cac1bd31f920b659e83bd1e597e1))

* updated sweep so that averagesweep will run a generic sweep if n_average is 1, so averagescan n_average can now be run successfully... you&#39;re welcome Jasmine! I am not sure what was changed in the average scans example notebook and this may have been accidental. Everything else is largely related to updated tests and sweep to accept these changes. ([`55810c8`](https://github.com/AMCOIndustries/pyscan/commit/55810c8e91c8d2d88c57f0114d8c521f6d077f0e))

Changes made to runinfo check() to make average scan and repeat scan mutually exclusive.
